- **Integration Options**: Available as a web app, CLI tool, and API service.

## ü§î The Problem: Documentation Rot

"Documentation rot" is a pervasive issue in the software development ecosystem. Technical tutorials, blog posts, and official documentation become outdated as libraries, frameworks, and languages evolve. A tutorial that worked perfectly a year ago might be riddled with errors today due to breaking changes in its dependencies.

This leads to:
- Wasted development time
- Frustration and decreased productivity
- Loss of trust in documentation sources
- Potential propagation of outdated or insecure practices

## üí° The Solution: VeriCode

VeriCode tackles this problem head-on by providing an automated way to verify that code examples in documentation still work with current versions of dependencies.

By simply providing a URL, VeriCode:
- Intelligently scrapes the page for code snippets
- Identifies the required technologies and their versions
- Executes each snippet in a sandboxed environment with the latest versions of those technologies
- Generates a clear, actionable "Freshness Report" that shows what still works and what's broken

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **URL Input**: You provide a URL to a technical article or tutorial.
2. **Scraping & Analysis**: VeriCode scrapes the page, extracts all code snippets, and intelligently detects the dependencies mentioned (e.g., express, react, prisma).
3. **Sandbox Execution**: Each code snippet is executed in a secure, isolated sandbox environment with the latest stable versions of its detected dependencies.
4. **Report Generation**: A detailed report is generated with an overall "Freshness Score," and a breakdown of which snippets passed, failed, or resulted in an error.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Getting VeriCode up and running on your local machine is simple, even for non-coders.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment

### Installation

#### For Windows Users:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vericode.git
cd vericode

# Run the setup script
double-click run-vericode.bat
```

#### For Mac/Linux Users:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vericode.git
cd vericode

# Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x run-vericode.sh
./run-vericode.sh
```

The script will handle installing dependencies, setting up the database, and starting the web server. Once it's ready, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vericode.git
cd vericode

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Set up the database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## üíª Technology Stack

VeriCode is built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod for validation

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI specification

### DevOps & Testing
- **Testing**: Jest, Testing Library, Playwright
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

VeriCode can be configured through environment variables:

```env
# Application
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# External Services
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret

# Sandbox Configuration
SANDBOX_TIMEOUT=30000
MAX_CONCURRENT_SANDBOXES=5
```

### Custom Sandbox Templates

You can create custom sandbox templates for specific technologies:

```javascript
// templates/javascript.js
module.exports = {
  setup: `
    const { dependencies } = require('./package.json');
    console.log('Installing dependencies:', Object.keys(dependencies).join(', '));
  `,
  timeout: 30000,
  allowedModules: ['express', 'react', 'lodash'],
  restrictedModules: ['fs', 'child_process']
};
```

## üìù API Documentation

VeriCode provides a RESTful API for integrating with other tools and services.

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key:

```http
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key
```

### Endpoints

#### Analyze a URL

```http
POST /api/analyze
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key

{
  "url": "https://example.com/tutorial",
  "options": {
    "forceRefresh": false,
    "includeDependencies": ["react", "express"]
  }
}
```

#### Get Analysis Results

```http
GET /api/analysis/{analysisId}
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key
```

For full API documentation, visit `/api/docs` when running the application.
