Start Verifying.</strong></p><p>VeriCode is a powerful tool that stress-tests technical documentation by executing code snippets against the latest dependencies in a sandboxed environment. Say goodbye to outdated tutorials and hello to reliable, verified code.</p></div>üåü Key FeaturesLive Code Validation: Executes code snippets in a secure, isolated environment to check for correctness.Dependency Freshness Check: Automatically detects dependencies and runs code against their latest stable versions.Detailed Error Reporting: Pinpoints exactly why a snippet is outdated, providing clear error messages and context.Freshness Score: Get an at-a-glance percentage score indicating how up-to-date and reliable a tutorial is.Community-Driven Caching: Popular articles are cached for instant results, with the option to trigger a fresh scan.Sharable Reports: Every scan generates a unique, sharable URL for its report, making it easy to collaborate and share findings.ü§î The Problem: Documentation Rot"Documentation rot" is a common problem where technical tutorials, blog posts, and official docs become outdated as libraries, frameworks, and languages evolve. A tutorial that worked perfectly a year ago might be riddled with errors today due to breaking changes in its dependencies. This leads to frustration and wasted time for developers.üí° The Solution: VeriCodeVeriCode tackles this problem head-on. By simply providing a URL, it intelligently scrapes the page for code snippets, identifies the required technologies, and executes each snippet in a sandboxed environment with the latest versions of those technologies. The result is a clear, actionable "Freshness Report" that shows what still works and what's broken.üõ†Ô∏è How It WorksURL Input: You provide a URL to a technical article or tutorial.Scraping & Analysis: VeriCode scrapes the page, extracts all code snippets, and intelligently detects the dependencies mentioned (e.g., express, react, prisma).Sandbox Execution: Each code snippet is executed in a secure, isolated sandbox environment with the latest stable versions of its detected dependencies.Report Generation: A detailed report is generated with an overall "Freshness Score," and a breakdown of which snippets passed, failed, or resulted in an error.üöÄ Quick StartGetting VeriCode up and running on your local machine is simple, even for non-coders.For Windows Users:Double-click the run-vericode.bat file.For Mac/Linux Users:Open your terminal.Make the script executable: chmod +x run-vericode.shRun the script: ./run-vericode.shThe script will handle installing dependencies, setting up the database, and starting the web server. Once it's ready, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.üíª Technology StackVeriCode is built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack:Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)Language: TypeScriptBackend: Node.js, Socket.IO for real-time updatesDatabase: Prisma ORM with SQLiteUI: React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, RechartsState Management: ZustandForms: React Hook Form with Zod for validationü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome!
